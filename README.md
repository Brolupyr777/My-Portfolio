# My-Portfolio
3 Basic Written Website-Games.
Although I don't hold the copyrights of the CSS and HTML of these three projects, all of them were provided for me in this udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/, and the github repositry where I got them: https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course
I did code the Javascript, and the DOM.
This Repository was created for my portfolio.
